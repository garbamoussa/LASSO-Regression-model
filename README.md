# LASSO-Regression-model
Lasso stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. It makes use of L1 regularization technique in the objective function. Lasso regression is a parsimonious model that performs L1 regularization. The L1 regularization adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute magnitude of regression coefficients and tries to minimize them Lasso regression can perform in-built variable selection as well as parameter shrinkage. While using ridge regression one may end up getting all the variables but with Shrinked Paramaters.
